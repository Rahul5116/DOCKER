# 🛠 Docker Volume Persistence with Bind Mounts on Linux Containers

## 📌 Overview  
This walkthrough shows how to use **bind mounts** in Docker with a Linux container, ensuring your files don’t disappear even when a container is deleted. We'll map a folder on your local machine into a running container, so your data stays safe.

---

## 🔧 Step-by-Step Process

### 🧱 Step 1: Start a Container with a Bind Mount  
Open your terminal and run:

```bash
docker run -dit --name alpine_bind_demo -v C:\Users\asus\docker_data:/data alpine:latest sh
```

### 🔍 Breakdown:
- Docker fetches the Alpine image if it's not already on your system.
- It creates a container named `alpine_bind_demo`.
- The `-v` flag links the host path `C:\Users\asus\docker_data` with `/data` in the container.
- Starts the container in the background with an interactive shell.

---

### 📝 Step 2: Add a File from Inside the Container  
Now, let’s create a test file:

```bash
docker exec -it alpine_bind_demo sh -c "echo 'Hello, Rahul!' > /data/testfile.txt"
```

### 🔍 What’s Going On?
- Executes a command inside the running container.
- Writes a file called `testfile.txt` into `/data` with the message **"Hello, Rahul!"**.
- Since `/data` is a bind mount, this file is saved in `C:\Users\asus\docker_data` on your host.

---

### ✅ Step 3: Confirm the File Exists  
Read the file from inside the container:

```bash
docker exec -it alpine_bind_demo sh -c "cat /data/testfile.txt"
```

#### 📌 Expected Output:
```
Hello, Rahul!
```

✔️ Success! The file was created inside the container and stored on the host.

---

### 🗑 Step 4: Remove the Container  
Time to delete the container:

```bash
docker rm -f alpine_bind_demo
```

### 🔍 Result:
- The container is force-removed.
- Your file isn’t lost — it lives in the host directory linked through the bind mount.

---

### 🔄 Step 5: Spin Up a New Container  
Let’s create a new container and reattach the same bind mount:

```bash
docker run -dit --name alpine_bind_new -v C:\Users\asus\docker_data:/data alpine sh
```

### 🔍 Explanation:
- A fresh container named `alpine_bind_new` is created.
- The same host folder is linked to `/data` again, letting us access the old data.

---

### 🔎 Step 6: Verify File Persistence  
Check if the file still exists in the new container:

```bash
docker exec -it alpine_bind_new sh -c "cat /data/testfile.txt"
```

#### 📌 Output:
```
Hello, Rahul!
```

✔️ Awesome! The file persisted through the container replacement — exactly what bind mounts are for.

## 🧠 Key Takeaways
- ✅ **Bind mounts keep your files safe** even when containers are removed.
- ✅ **Reusing the same bind mount path** lets different containers access the same data.
- ✅ **Perfect for development** where you want to share or persist data across multiple runs.

## 🚀 What to Explore Next
🔸 Try using **named volumes** (`docker volume create`) for a more Docker-native approach to storage.  
🔸 Experiment with **bind mounts and different images** to build flexible workflows.  
🔸 Learn about **file permissions** to manage access between host and container effectively.
